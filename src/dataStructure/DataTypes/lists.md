# list

- Insertion of an element:
  - Insertion of an element to the end of a list has a constant time complexity. => o(1)
- Deletion of an element:
  - In worst case scenario the program might might need to traverse the entire list before removing the desired element. => O(n)
- Slicing:
  - The operation can take time proportional to the size of the new slice => O(n)
- Element Retrieval without indexing:
  - Might take scanning the whole list before finding the element => o(n).
- Copying
  - O(n)
