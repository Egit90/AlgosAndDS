# Sets

- JS VS Python
  - creating a set
    - `python my_set = {1,2,3}`
    - `js let mySet = new Set([1,2,3])`
  - Duplicates JS and Python don't allow for duplicate elements in sets.
  - Both are mutable.

ðŸ’¡ GO Does not have sets.

## Time Complexity:

    - Add an Element: O(1)
    - Remove an Element: O(1)
    - Copy: O(n)
